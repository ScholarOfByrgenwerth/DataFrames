# DataFrames with Pandas

# I made a simple program here to parse through thousands of data points on an excel sheet and create Data Frames with Pandas
# The ultimate goal was to find one disprepancy between two sheets containing thousands of data points
# This allowed me to find where two elements were not equal, and index an incorrectly entered data point from one of the excel sheets
